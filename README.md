We as penetration testers should therefore never be discouraged by new defensive mechanisms, but treat them as opportunities to create more sophisticated attacks.

Failing to plan is planning to fail.

Don't give up, and remember the Try Harder mindset!

If my attack or defense fails, it represents a truth about my current skills/processes/configurations/approach as much as it is a truth about the system.
If my attack or defense fails, this allows me to learn something new, change my approach, and do something differently.

The more you repeat, the more words you read.

望文生义的根源第一个是懒，第二个是自以为是，第三个是既懒又自以为是而产生、又恰恰因为既懒又自以为是而难以克服的自我局限。

不知道并不可怕，可怕的是你不知道你不知道。
